## Unsolved Problems or Major Hurdles
> Currently there are no unsolved problems. Major hurdles that had to be overcome were how to design the core functionality architecture. Before writing any line of code, a lot of thought was given to what would be the correct approach in developing the game logic so that there would be a clear path to developing the functionality.
